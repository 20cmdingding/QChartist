Changes.txt


July 14, 2008 (2.02)
- Added the "Arrange Document Tabs" that was removed from the JellyFish Pro to JellyFB conversion.


May 26, 2008 (2.01)
- Fixed the F6/Shift+F6 function jumping routine to propery recognize subs/functions that are prefixed by "Private".


May 23, 2008 (2.00)
- Changed the name from the JellyFish Pro Editor (FreeBASIC), to JellyFB Editor. It sure is easier to remember!
- Added preprocessor directive '#LANG. The directive can have the following uses and determines what code language for the FB compiler to use:

    '#LANG FB
    '#LANG QB
    '#LANG FBLITE
    '#LANG DEPRECATED

- Got rid of a lot of "junk" from the code base. Dropped some things from the editor to make it more streamlined. 
- Now uses a 'pipe' to capture the compiler output rather than relying on redirection to a log file (previously text was captured in 'compiler.log').
- Updated to the most recent FreeBASIC help file (i.e. fbdoc.chm)
- Updated the JellyFB help file.
- Updated the list of supported FreeBASIC keywords.


January 27, 2007 (1.72)
- Small change to allow Shell to FB compiler when compiler is located in a long file directory containing spaces (e.g. c:\Program Files\FreeBASIC)


May 27, 2006 (1.71)
- Modified error handling code to handle the new FreeBASIC 0.16b compiler log file format.
- Introduced block comment handling via the /' and '/ syntax. (May 27, 2006, version of the compiler)
- Now using a custom dialog with fixed font to display compiler error messages.
- The 'compiler.log' file is now deleted after a compile.



May 9, 2006 (1.70)
- Added F1 support for the FreeBASIC help file (fb.chm)
- Fixed erroneous error message that displays when F1 Help invoked but the cursor is not over a valid win32 keyword.


August 26, 2005 (1.65)
- Chr(160)'s are removed from the clipboard during a paste. This allows the user to copy and paste code directly from the FreeBASIC Forum without compile time errors.
- The temporary log file generated by the compiler is no longer deleted. The file is named "compiler.log".
- Added the <E> option in order to pass the compiled EXE's name to a User Tool.
- Added a preprocessor to the compile process. The source file bing compiled is checked for special directives that get sent to the compiler.
    '#COMPILE EXE|DLL|LIB
    '#RESOURCE myresource.rc
    '#DEBUG ON|OFF
    '#LIBPATH libpath
    '#PROFILE ON|OFF 
    '#CONSOLE ON|OFF
- Updated the Help file.


August 21, 2005 (1.60)
- Added "User Tools" that allows the user to define external applications that can be invoked by the user by
selecting it from the "View" menu or during pre or post compile.

August 5, 2005 (1.55)
- Added check to detect if error occurred during compiling of a resource script (*.rc).

August 2, 2005 (1.54)
- Compiler command options are now saved on a per project basis.
- Changed from using COLOR_MENU to COLOR_3DFACE brush for the editor's toolbar.
- Added a compile check to throw an error if the resulting file is zero-length.
- Corrected problem whereby files passed to JPro via the command line would not open.

July 30, 2005 (1.53)
- Corrected problem where correct directory was not set prior to initiating a compile.
- Added all of the FreeBASIC intrinsic functions to the built-in CodeTip popups.
- Moved the FreeBASIC CodeTip popup definitions to an external file (codetips.lng).

July 26, 2005 (1.52)
- Corrected problem whereby compile would fail on Win9x machines.
- Corrected bug whereby compiling file names containing spaces would fail.
- Much improved compile message output. 

July 25, 2005 (1.51)
- Corrected problem whereby editor font was not being set when initialization file was read.
- Added alternative syntax words for statements that use a trailing "$" as an option (e.g. Mid, Str, etc...).
- Corrected problem whereby the "F4" Function List did not recognize subs/functions with Private/Public keywords.

July 24, 2005 (1.50)
- Initial FreeBASIC release.
