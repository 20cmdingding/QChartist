ETHICS OF USE:
The first and most important thing to do before using this software is to awake your consciousness on these points:
Technological advances have pro and cons depending entirely on our ego and spiritual accomplishment.
Our educational institutions teach us to idolize the intellect, often at the expense of our moral, ethical, 
and spiritual development. Our economic institutions urge us to be consumers, and those who have gained the 
most material wealth are glorified. But this attitude, where the ego gets blown out of proportion lead us 
directly to the destruction of our planet and to our own extinction.
As a consequence of the collective ego being out of balance with the eco:
In recent decades, an entire generation of western scientists, a formidable force of intelligence, focused all 
its efforts on developing new ways to kill huge numbers of human beings all at once. This was the nuclear arms 
of the 1950s through the present - which left us with environmental disasters yet to be cleaned up, 
a huge amount of natural materials gone to total waste (5.5 trillion dollars worth), 1 a military death toll 
consisting of hundreds of thousands of innocent non-combatants, and the threat of nuclear annihilation hanging 
over all of the peace-loving peoples of the world, even today.
Other facts that are directly due to egocentrism and the lack of spiritual education:
the soiling of the planet with petroleum and chemicals, deforestation, food quantity at the expense of quality,
global warming, desinformation, illness, conflicts, violence
By using this software, i would like that you be responsible and compassionate for everybody 
(human and non-human) and everything. This can be done by respecting some fundamental rules of good behaviour 
like these:
- practice nonjudgment, begin the day with a resolve to not judge anything that occurs
- love everybody and everything in an unconditional way, think and give love to everyone you encounter,
receive what people give to you with gratitude
- when you make a choice, ask yourself "what are the consequences of this choice?" and "will this choice bring
happiness to everybody?"
- concentrate your emotions and feelings on the present moment, and not on the past nor on the future
that you imagine to be
- take responsibility for your situation without blaming anything or any one, including yourself. Every problem
is a sign that you have to break your habits
- Relinquish the need to defend your point of view and be open to all points of view
- do all things with humility for the well-being of the living universe of which we are the cells, and 
relinquish the attachment to the outcome. Be aware that our desires will be realized if they serve the whole.
Let the universe handle the details
- ask yourself daily "how can i help? & "how can i serve?". Serve your fellow human beings with love.
You can use your talents for that
- don't think that you are supperior or inferior to the others
- be compassionate: be aware that your happiness depends on the happiness of all what surrounds you
- enlarge your consciousness of who you really are, larger than just your physical body

I repeat once again that you mustn't use this software for your greed but to serve the world.
You mustn't use this software to compete, but to cooperate with others.
Don't foster the closing of markets, but the opening of hearts.

Today, new perspectives are emerging regarding the nature of human existence. The Earth itself is becoming 
recognized as a living entity, a level of Being immensely greater than the human level. The galaxy and universe 
are seen as even higher levels of Being, with multiverses (multiple universes) theorized as existing at a higher 
level yet. All of these levels of Being are thought to be imbued with the energy of life, as well as with a form 
of consciousness which we cannot even begin to comprehend. As we humans expand our knowledge of ourselves and 
recognize our true place in the vast scheme of things, our egos must defer to reality. We must admit our absolute 
dependence upon the ecosystem we call Earth, and try to balance our egotistical feelings of self-importance with 
our need to live in harmony with the greater world around us.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unzip all files into a clean folder, ("C:\QChartist" recommanded).

Use QChartist.exe to start the program
Use QTStart.bat to compile and start the program after modifying the source code or adding new indicators
Use QTGen.exe to create your own indicators
Use JFE IDLE to edit sources files
Use QTGuard.exe to start the expert (automated analysis) (you need to specify the csv path first in QT menu file>settings
where QC will pick charts from)

What can i do with QChartist?

Revision after revision, QT allows more and more functionalities. It is really a flexible software with extensive 
functionalities. 

- You can open multiple charts at the same time. (Click on Import CSV or menu File>Import CSV)
- You can switch from one to another. (Click on Display chart box)
- You can close each of your opened charts separatly. (Click on the red cross in the upper right corner of your chart)
- You can scroll your charts backwards or forwards. (Click on the scrollbar bellow your chart)
- You can choose how many bars to display on screen. (Click on Display +- bars or enter a number of bars in the box and click OK)
- You can set the space you want in front of your charts. (Click on space forwards box, enter a number of pixels and click OK)
- You can change the timeframe multiplier:
for example if you open a H1 chart, and if you change the timeframe multiplier to 2, you will have a H2 chart displayed on the screen
- You can draw geometrical figures:
	- trendline
	- Fibonacci fan
	- Fibonacci retracements
	- horizontal line
	- vertical line
	- square
	- equilateral triangle
	- circle
	- cross
	- inverted circle
	- text
	- Andrews pitchforks
	- Cycle lines
	- Log/Exp curves
	- Price/Time extensions
	- sinusoids	
	- And many many more

- You can see x,y coordinates (pixels,price,date), angle, length (pixels) of your geometrical figures (Windows menu>Tools informations)

- You can put indicators on your charts (Click on Indicators):
	- Simple Moving Average
	- Bollinger Bands
	- Vegas Channel
	- BB - HL
	- ATR Channel
	- Average Range
	- Center Of Gravity	
	- And many many more

- You can put indicators on the separate canvas (Click on Indicators):
	- Close Price
	- Money Flow Index
	- Average True Range
	- Value Chart
	- Relative Strength Index
	- And many many more
	You need to click on menu Windows > Canvas in order to show the separate canvas

- You can change the indicators settings
- You can change the counted bars for your indicators (Click on the box and enter a number of bars)
- You can make charts additions or subtractions (Click on Mixer)
- You can save your charts as BMP files (Click on Save)
- You can export charts as CSV files (Click on Export CSV)
- You can print your charts (Click on Print)
- You can change the axis type to normal,logarithmic
- You can change the chart type to candlesticks,line,point,polar,...
- You can use custom timeframes

- And many many more...

- You can create your own experts which will analyse your charts automatically and alert you for a signal
(this is done with the use of QTGuard and some csv files gathered in the same folder (you need to specify the csv path 
first in QT menu file>settings where QT will pick charts from))

Source code of QC is fully included for multiple reasons : 
- portions of code written under the GPL license belong to their respective authors
- this will allow many programmers to contribute to the project and to improve it strongly
- in order to include new indicators in the program, the entire source code must be recompiled
Since QC is delivered with its entire source code, compiler, programming guide, and IDLE, it is easy 
and rapid to extend its possibilities, even for novice programmers (Basic language).

Currently the software cannot use realtime quotes, which means that you can only import historical data from
local files or Yahoo Finance. Maybe the use of realtime quotes will be available in a future release.

How to open a chart?

You just need to have a .csv file correctly formatted in order to do so.

CSV file format must be like this:

date (YYYY.MM.DD),time (HH:MM),open,high,low,close,volume

QChartist uses the same csv format as in the MetaTrader 4 history center

For example, your CSV file must begin with something like:

2010.01.29,00:00,1.05242,1.05467,1.05054,1.05215,17030

You can check this with Notepad.
All fields must be present. If you don't use time in your file (for daily or more), you need to have a time column with 00:00 
for all rows in your file.

You can change the order of each column and the separator character can be a coma (,) or anything else. When your click on 
import CSV in QChartist, your can enter the position of each column in your CSV and the separator character. 
Position 1 is the first column in your file. After that, click on open file and choose your file. 
In order to format your files correctly, you can use your usual office suite to do this. 
You must not use " " delimiters in your CSV file.

Configuration required:

QChartist was successfully tested under 4 different configs:
- Windows 7 familial 64 bit with an Intel Celeron 2.66 GHz CPU with 2 Go RAM and works properly.
- Windows XP home SP2 with an Intel Celeron 2.66 GHz CPU with 1 Go RAM and works properly.
- Ubuntu 8.04.1 under Wine with an Intel Atom 1.6 GHz CPU with 1 Go RAM and works properly.
- Ubuntu 12.04 under Wine with an Intel Atom 1.6 GHz CPU with 1 Go RAM and works properly.
It should also work under Windows 9x,NT,2000,Me,Vista,7
It should also work under other Linux distributions with Wine 

Thank you for using and supporting my software! I hope you like it and find it useful.

2010-08-13:
man can easily code and integrate new indicators in the program. Thanks to the flexibility of the RapidQ basic language and its simplicity of use,
possibilities for indicators coding are almost unlimited. I hope this will encourage people to share their own indicators!

2010-08-26:
you can calibrate your mouse if necessary (Tools menu)

2010-09-04:
you can export your charts in CSV files format (useful when using mixer or logarithmic axis type conversions)
hotkeys can be used: ESCape key for cancel figure (same as mouse right-click), space key for inserting figure (same as mouse left-click)
price and time for current cursor position is indicated in menu Windows>Tools informations
Highest high, lowest low and other useful informations are displayed in the tools informations window
you can change the plot area color (tools menu)

2010-09-06:
figures drawn are now persistent when scrolling chart. this was quite complicated to program (and still buggy)

2010-09-07:
You can view the list grid of objects drawn in menu Windows>Objects list
By this way, you can add,modify,delete coordinates of the desired objects manually

2010-09-08:
You can change chart type:candlesticks,line,point,bar,ribbon,pretzel,stepped
You can draw Andrews pitchforks

2010-09-09:
Chart type: "Polar" available

2010-09-23:
New indicator: Time Series Forecast
New drawing tools:
- Gann Square of 9
- Gann Square of 144

2010-09-24:
Not useful at all but nice toy: multimedia scene in the about form

2010-09-25:
New drawing tools:
- Time extensions
- Gann Time Square of 9
- Gann Time Square of 144
- Price cycles
- Time cycles

2010-09-27:
- You can scroll charts with the mouse wheel
- Tools are in a dockform which can be easily moved
- Custom splitters allow to resize canvas easily

2010-09-28:
- New selection tool allows to move,delete,duplicate objects with a right-click on the objects drawn on the chart
(only work with trendlines by now, but needs to be ported to the other tools)

2010-10-07:
- Multiplications and divisions available in mixer form
For example if you open EURUSD60 and then you add USDCHF60 in the multiplications list, you will have an EURCHF60 chart
on your screen
- volume correction in mixer

2010-10-09:
- You can configure ratios in the mixer ; it is the same as Price ratio on the main form (it can be a decimal value)
This is useful when you switch to logarithmic scale, the way that you can scale, center and see your chart correctly in
the canvas
- You can reverse chart manually or periodically in mixer>other operations : this allow you to remodel your charts
You should reverse from the past to the present, all bars on the right will be reversed
Even after symmetrical manipulations on your chart, and even if prices won't correspond to the reality anylonger, 
its reliability will be the same as long as you trade in the direction which corresponds.
Please take care that if you reverse the chart continuity, you will have to trade in the inverse direction of your signal
Bar # on cursor added in tools informations
If the number of times you reverse the bars gives you an odd number, trading direction should be inverted 
(buy if it shows a sell signal or sell if it shows a buy signal)

2010-10-10:
- Reverse chart algorithm improved
- You can left-click on a bar with the selection tool to highlight it and show the number,date and time 
(more precise than aiming tool and tools info)

2010-10-11:
- Debug of the cog indicator
New indicators:
- Volatility Pivot
- Accelerator
- Candle Average
- Force Index

- Hotkeys removed because not working yet
- Debug of the reverse bars function

2010-10-12:
- Debug of the closing separate canvas function
- Debug of the switch between multiple opened charts function
- You can reverse bars simply with the selection tool: right-click on a bar
- Important actions are logged in a textbox in menu Windows>Reverse log and also in the file QChartist.log

2010-10-15:
- You can find a bar from a date: menu Edit>Find bar
Choose a date in the calendar, type the time in the box (hh:mm) and click "Find bar"
If the searched bar is found, the chart will scroll automatically to the correct date and 
the bar is highlighted in green

2010-10-17:
When you close the last chart:
- timeframe multiplier goes back to 1 
- all indicators are unchecked
counted bars set to 250

- In menu Edit > Reverse Bars is added, it's a useful alternative to the right-click on a bar with the selection tool
- Size of the reverse log reduced and scrollbars added

2010-10-17:
- Useless portions of code removed

2010-10-28:
Some improvements made to speed up usual analysis:
- Important chart manipulations are logged on hard drive to QChartist.log This is a good security in case of bug or crash
- Hint removed on the scrollbar because this makes it almost unpracticable (this was in the code example but we don't need it)
- When you export a csv, proper filename is shown in the savedialog with the tf multiplier at the end
- Displayed bars go back to 100 when you close you charts
- When you click on a bar with the selection tool, moving your mouse during the procedure do not impact on your primary click
- When you reverse bars, chart stays at the same scrollposition
- Counted bars set to 225
- You can disable indicators rapidly
- Presets for most often used timeframe multipliers in a combobox:
	- use 48 to convert a 30m chart > daily chart
	- use 336 to convert a 30m chart > weekly chart
	- use 24 to convert a 1h chart > daily chart
	- use 168 to convert a 1h chart > weekly chart
	- use 6 to convert a 4h chart > daily chart
	- use 42 to convert a 4h chart > weekly chart
- You can switch displayed bars between 10<->100 with the same scrollposition
- You can reverse parts of your chart automatically from a log file:
If you reversed parts of your chart, lines are saved in the QChartist.log
then you can create a new log file with thoses lines that you will open in the program (menu Edit>Reverse from file...)
(you need to open the same csv first)

2010-10-29:
- "Use indicators" check boxes are synchronized
- You can draw equiangular spirals!

2010-10-30:
- You can change vertical axis type to logarithmic!
- You can adjust the vertical axis scaling
- You can change the price ratio (Mixer>Other operations):
this is useful when you want to show the logarithmic axis type if the price is < 1 for example:
if average price is 0.62, put a price ratio of 2, now with an average price of 1.24,  
the logarithmic axis type will work, then just use the trackbar to have the chart in the entire window

2010-10-31:
- Indicators work with both axis type
- You can export chart with both axis type
- You can add/remove indicators with a double-click
- Volatility Pivot bars back changed to 150

2010-11-10:
- Horizontal toolbar with icons for common tasks and chart tweaks
next todo: to be able to resize chart from the top and the right with splitters

2011-01-13:
- New indicator available: ZigZag

2011-01-14:
- Automation script for experts creation and signal detection
This works like a macro, cpu takes control over the app and plays with charts choosen randomly
You can stop the process with the stop button on the upper right corner
When a signal is detected, a window popups up with a nice looped sound
Notice that you can't work on another window during the automation or the app may crash
Moreover you should disable your screensaver or the app may crash
Before using this script, you have to set a path for the csv folder
Then import any csv you want and set displayed bars and counted bars to 300 
Start the automation script: Tools > Automation > Reverse
Be aware that this will take high cpu usage
- You can tune automation settings

2011-01-17:
- QTGuard permits to emit sound alert if QChartist crashs
How the guard works? 
QT saves current timestamp into alive.log at regular intervals
When you start the timer:
QTGuard reads alive.log periodically and compares its value to the current timestamp
If the gap is too important, QTGuard emits sound
- Application settings are stored into ini file. At application start-up, settings are restored from it

2011-01-23:
- QTGuard restart QT automatically if the instance crashs
Then QT do works in automation mode at the app startup if automation=1 in the ini file
- You can switch ini automation=0/1 with QTGuard "start automation" button
if you stop automation from QTGuard while QT is already running, QT will stop 
automation at the next loop attempt
if you start automation, a new instance of QT will run (if the timer is started)
- You can stop/start QTGuard timer with the "start timer" button
starting timer allows to read alive.log periodically and compares its value to the current timestamp
If the gap is too important, QTGuard emits sound and tries to restart QT again
- QTGuard "Give up" button allows to stop emitting sound and stop trying to restart QT 
(if automation=1 in the ini file) but still continues to work with the timer 
(QTGuard still continues to reads alive.log periodically and compares its value to the current timestamp
If the gap is too important, QTGuard emits sound again and tries to restart QT again)
- If QT detects a signal, in QTGuard GUI click on "Stop timer" then click "Give up" and click on
"Stop automation" 
If you want to resume QT automation, in QTGuard click on "Start automation"
go back in QT GUI and click on tools>automation>reverse then in the QTGuard GUI click on "Start timer"
- You can disable/enable sounds in QTGuard

2011-01-24:
- Correction of a bug with automation that maked QT crashing (under Linux with Wine) when using BB-HL
Before using automation, please set alive.log at 0 and set the CSV path correctly in the ini file
- Correction of a bug when signal is detected QTGuard still ran a new session of QT ; the problem dealed
with alive.log and is now resolved thanks to a timer...
- Bug that maked cog malfunction caused by the public variable i resolved

2011-02-04:
- Log window enlarged
- QTGuard windowstate set to 3 (no minimize button available) in order to favour the proper functionning of the
app (because it seems to need to keep a "pseudo focus...") especially with Wine under Linux

2011-02-21:
- Bug correction: in automation mode, sometimes MT4 periodconvertermultipair script saves csv files with size=0,
if this is the case: QT tries another file

2011-04-01:
- Murray Math indicator (still a little buggy)

2011-04-06:
- RSI indicator
- StepRSI indicator
- StepRSI conditions added to the automation macro

2011-04-07:
- Murray Math indicator fully functional
- Fibo MA Channels indicator (you must put countedbars to 320 for proper functioning
- Fibo MA Channels conditions added to the automation macro

2011-04-09:
- Code optimizations
- windows module added in addition to rapidq2 module (many lines commented because already exist in rq2 module)
this module is needed for the "edit chart" tool explained below
- drawing tool "edit chart" will allow modifying chart bar by bar. This will be useful to make a transfer from bmp,
or chart overlays

2011-04-10:
- Murrey Math indicator improved

2011-04-11:
- writealivetimer added many times in automation script if it crashes many times, which allows to reduce
the maximum lag accepted to 20000 milliseconds in QTGuard (now QT restarts more rapidely with this adjustment)
- MurreyMath indicator moved away because it makes the app to crash when using automation especially under Linux 
but can still be added in the indexation if needed. This indicator still needs to be debugged.

2011-04-12:
- expert script (automation) doesn't like defint declarations which makes it crash. Problem solved by replacing 
defint myvar with dim myvar as integer. Maybe this is the same case with Murrey Math indicator
- QTGuard's Maximum lag accepted in milliseconds set to 30000 because using a lower value will open multiple sessions
at the same time which will flood the cpu (valid for an 1.66 Ghz cpu with 1Go RAM else you will need to try other values)

2011-04-13:
- Fixed: sometimes signal sound didn't work 
- New expert: exitsignal accessible with QTGuard, useful when you are already in a trade
- I noticed that sometimes, MT4 server freezes (no more data feeds) even if client statut 
is still connected. This is a problem because the client stops delivering quotes and doesn't 
autoreconnect since the moment that its statut is still connected. That's why i created a mt4
script called alive.mq4 which job is to write at every tick the current server time in a file 
(alive.log) Now, QTGuard checks the MT4 alive.log regulary and emits sound if MT4 server timeouts 
(no change in the file after 300 seconds). If you hear this sound then you know
that you need to reconnect your MT4 client manually.

2011-04-14:
- Fibo MA Channels removed from automation expert because doesn't work properly

2011-04-17:
- third party folder added containing:
	- alglib: It is aimed at creating a convenient and efficient multilingual scientific 
	software library. It is focused on numerical analysis.
	- fft: Fast Fourier Transform routines for power of 2 data sets
	- tracer11: Extracts plotted data points from bitmap files	
- some alglib routines included into QC
- indicator using Incomplete gamma integral routines for testing purposes
All third party tools are freeware or under the General Public License

2011-04-18:
- new third party tools added because they are nice complements for QC 
(chart-224, chartstyle, GT, rapid, aiotrade, gchartman, itrade, qtstalker, xinvest)
- Fixes in QTGen

2011-08-18:
- QC can send emails when a signal is detected and if mt4 client is disconnected
- new third party tool lab fit functions

2011-08-20:
- Settings for the tools>mailer are saved in the ini file and are restored if you restart 
QChartist

2011-08-21:
- Added some astro dlls and grace in the third party folder

2011-08-24:
- Added TA-Lib and point & figure sources code in the third party foler

2011-08-28: window relocated correctly (upper left corner)

2011-08-30
Added plchart in the third party foler
Indicator psi removed

2011-09-02:
Number of bytes required for a csv to be opened increased (for the automation)
The mailer in QTGuard save and restore your parameters (from the .ini file) (used in case of mt4
disconnection). The same parameters are used for the mailer in QChartist Tools menu 

2011-09-20:
- Envelop indicator

2011-09-30:
- Tools>Automation>Follow mode: used for chart update...
- for MT4: 
	- alive helps to detect MT4 freeze or disconnections
	- Period_Converter_Opt_multipairs puts csv of all pairs in the "file" folder
		useful for QC automation
- Third party tools is available in a separated archive for more convenience

2011-10-08:
- You can export collection that means:
for example:
if the current opened file timeframe is 30x4 (multiplier of 4), it will export: 30x4 csv,30x48 csv (daily),
30x336 csv (weekly)
Important: filenames must be the same as MT4 exported csvs
Then you can import those files in the MT4 history center
Remember, presets for most often used timeframe multipliers are:
	- use 48 to convert a 30m chart > daily chart
	- use 336 to convert a 30m chart > weekly chart
	- use 24 to convert a 1h chart > daily chart
	- use 168 to convert a 1h chart > weekly chart
	- use 6 to convert a 4h chart > daily chart
	- use 42 to convert a 4h chart > weekly chart

2011-10-28:
- New indicator: The Five-Day LSS Oscillator
- LSS Oscillator conditions added to the automation macro

2011-11-03:
- Bug correction in the Express Mailer, now it can save and restore settings properly

2011-11-06:
- If you are under Windows 7 and you want to recompile the program,
put "$optimize off" but some functionnalities won't work anylonger

2011-11-08:
- In order to compile the program under Windows 7, right-click on RC.exe > 
Properties > Compatibility > Execute the program in compatibility for Windows XP SP3

- Execute QTstart.bat 
Compilation should work now :-)

2011-11-09:
- LSS Oscillator conditions removed from the automation macro because malfunction of the indicator

2011-12-07:
- QC connects to a signal server on start-up (this allows to share everyone's the potential signals online)
- The chat client allows to see the signals found by the community in realtime
- A tutorial made in docs folder (Clustering - searching for signals tutorial) which helps finding signals
- Now QC doesn't stops when a signal is found (nor alerts for it), it just save the signal in the file signals.log 
and continues to find other signals

2011-12-10:
- You can export just one line from the chat client/server into the file reversetmp.log
Then in QC, import the appropriate chart (csv) and then you can click the menu
 Edit > reverse bars from file... and specify reversetmp.log

2011-12-14:
- signal client/server connection removed because server crashed too often
- we go back to version of the 2011-11-09 because scrolling chart didn't work anylonger
- QC doesn't stops when a signal is found (nor alerts for it), it just save the signal in the file signals.log 
and continues to find other signals

2011-12-17:
- QC saves each signal in a new file (timestamp+symbol+period+(.csv)+timeframe multiplier.log)

2012-08-11:
- You can import charts from Yahoo! Finance in menu File>Data source (Only Windows compatible by now)

2013-01-19:
- QC saves a bmp of the chart for each signal in a new file (timestamp+symbol+period+(.csv)+timeframe multiplier.bmp)

2013-01-20:
- Conditions added in the autoreverse sub. You must use Din_fibo_high_crawler script + Period_Converter_Opt_multipairs script in MT4
Now the autoreverse script only analyses charts where price is near the high or the low of the Din_fibo_high channel

2013-01-21:
- Conditions added in the autoreverse sub. There is a signal only if the price in MT4 is near a high or a low of the Din_fibo_high 
channel and the reversed chart in QChartist is pointing in the same direction 

2013-01-22:
- Rules modified for the autoreverse sub.

2013-01-23:
- QTGuard Exit signal is working. First you need to specify the CSV file for exit
signal in QChartist menu files>settings and you need to put the appropriate file 
reversetmp.log in the root of QChartist program. Then you can start QTGuard Exit signal.
- QChartist sends signal emails for both entry and exit signals.
- Popup messages for send mail function removed, in this way QChartist can continue to
analyse new charts

2013-01-25:
- Send mail function was blocking in QChartist for entry signal, thus i created program
named sendmail.exe. Now QChartist runs this program to send entry mails and it is working
fine.
- I have troubles with sendmail.exe and qini because when Qchartist runs sendmail, sendmail 
is not able to get the data from QChartist.ini. Thus you need to edit sendmail.bas with 
JFE.exe, put your own smtp and emails and recompile sendmail.
- Problem solved with sendmail. I needed to put the correct curdir$ with chdir in QChartist 
before running sendmail.exe. Now you can specify your own smtp,from,to,subject,message in
qchartist.ini

2013-02-06:
- I noticed that some functionnalities don't work with Windows 7 64 bits (especially some indicators)
In order to be able to use all the features of QChartist, I recommand to run QChartist 
on Ubuntu 8.04.1 Hardy Heron with Wine or Windows XP 32-bit.
If you are under Windows 64-bit you can try VirtualBox...

2014-04-24:
- rc.exe compiler replaced with snakedile's patched rc.exe in order to correct compilation error related to
temp files if you don't have admin rights under windows. Now, temp files are created in the current directory
where rc.exe is located.

2014-04-25:
- correction of the relative coordinates for the cursor (not finished yet)

2014-05-17:
- all time high and all time low added in the tools information
- you can convert charts to an exponential base 10 ratio in menu Edit>Chart conversions
this tool is useful for contrarian traders who are looking for tops and bottoms. Tuning your chart
to an exponential scale helps to reveal market turning points
- exponential base 10 ratio transformation added to the automated expert

2014-05-19:
- added function save chart to tmp grid in menu Edit>Save chart to tmp grid 
(needed before you change the timeframe multiplier when 
you transform chart to exp base 10 ratio). Always transform chart to exp base 10 ratio with 
a timeframe multiplier of 1. Then click on Save chart to tmp grid. Then you can change the 
timeframe multiplier.
- exponential base 10 ratio transformation added to the exitsignal script
- alive.log is set to 0 when QTGuard is started

2014-05-23:
- added Buy or Sell signal radio buttons for exit signal in QTGuard
if you want to check for an exit signal and the entry signal was a buy, click the Buy radio button
if you want to check for an exit signal and the entry signal was a sell, click the Sell radio button
your choice is saved in qchartist.ini exitsignaldir= (1=buy, 0=sell)
- exit signal expert conditions now depends on the choice made for exitsignaldir= in qchartist.ini

2014-05-25:
- code beautified with FreeQ
- replaced exit sub with exit function to avoid compilation warnings

2014-05-27:
- Under Windows 7 64 bit, in order to avoid crash when using certain indicators, right click 
on QChartist.exe, then click on properties, click on the compatibility tab, check "execute this 
program in compatibility mode for : Windows NT4"
- Added RapidQ Pre Compiler RQPC Engine makes it possible to include FreeBasic code in the program
(please note that adding C++ code makes certain indicators not working)
- In order to compile QChartist with RQPC, you need to copy RQ32.DLL in your Windows folder and rename it
RapidQ32.dll in your Windows folder
- Added QChartist.chm documentation in the docs folder
- Added FreeBASIC compiler
- Added FreeQ IDLE
- Added JellyFB IDLE
- Added MinGW compiler
- Added third party tools in the misc folder
- Added HelpMaker Help Authoring Tool in the vahelp folder ; useful if someone wants to enrich the
QChartist.chm file
- Added FreeBASIC chm and pdf documentation
- Added ClickTeam Install Creator in misc folder useful if you make changes in the program
- Now QChartist size is a bit heavy (about 350 Mo)

2014-05-28:
- You can include Borland C++ code in the program
- You can attribute timeframes to your charts. This is useful if you want to call a particular
chart in your indicators. For example if you want to draw the price of MSFT1440 in YHOO1440,
open MSFT1440.csv and YHOO1440.csv, display chart 1 on the screen (MSFT1440.csv), click on menu
Edit>Attribute timeframe, choose 1440, close the TF attribution windows, display chart 2 (YHOO1440.csv),
select priceclose1440 indicator. priceclose indicator uses close1440() instead of close() in order to
draw the result. You can also create indicators that need multiple timeframes of the same symbol.
- QTGuard improved QChartist timeout detection

2014-05-29:
- Bug with indicators descriptions solved
- Added Home Planet C++ code

2014-05-30:
- Function ibarshift added. Now you can use multitimeframe indicators, for example ADR112
but it's very very slow. To use ADR112: open a Weekly chart and attribute timeframe 10080 to it.
Then open the same symbol chart with a smaller timeframe. Select ADR112 indicator, wait, and see !
- QTGuard tries to kill QChartist.exe and sendmail.exe before restarting QChartist
- ? menu added which can load the chm help file and show the about form

2014-06-01:
- file readfilespecificline.bpp added, containing several functions:
filegetline: gets one line from a file
filegetlinecount: gets number of lines in a file
filegetalllines: gets one line from a file depending on the fseek position
- all bpp files are grouped into bppincludes.bpp because rqpc accepts only one pre cmd line with one bpp inclusion
- because getting lines from rapidq opened filestream is too slow, i added a sub importfiletest in order to 
import csv using the cpp filegetalllines function (not finished yet)

2014-06-02:
- indicators bugs correction:
sometimes rapidq dislikes my public array variables declared in qti indicators (which are used in qti subs), 
except the one which is used to plot in the qtr indicator ; the solution is to declare qstringgrid 
variables in the qti files (but it complicates the code)
sometimes rapidq dislikes when you attribute 0 to a sub parameter, thus avoid calling subs with 0 parameter

2014-06-04:
- csv files are opened using c++ functions from readfilespecificline.bpp which is a lot faster
I discovered that when you call a c++ function using int parameters it doesn't work (this fails under 
Wine 1.0 but works under Windows). You need to use string parameters as in the filegetalllines function 
and then convert your char to int with atoi()
- problem with import file from yahoo needs to be corrected

2014-06-09:
- added Boost C++ Libraries (needed to use arrays)
- added c++ functions in readfilespecificline.bpp:
	* filegetlinesarray() : loads a file and put data into date,time,open,high,low,close,volume arrays
	* writetofile() : write date,time,open,high,low,close,volume arrays data into a csv file

2014-06-11:
- added special thanks in the about form
- added readme in the ? menu
- added icons for programs

2014-06-13:

2014-06-18:
- added C++ math functions to RapidQ

2014-06-21:
- filegetalllines c++ function optimized
- added additional documentation about Win32 api, RapidQ

2014-06-22:

- you can code indicators in C++ :-)
implementation of the first indicator written in C++ (Bollinger Bands) :
// ''RQEXPORT function bandscpp()
bandscpp is available in the indicators list of QChartist and is fully functionnal
The interest of coding indicators in C++ is a huge increase of speed for the drawing on the chart
- indicators settings now saved in ini files
- QTGen modified to save indicators settings in ini files
- In QTGen you can choose between RapidQ or C++ source code (not functionnal yet)

2014-06-24:
- QTGen choice between RapidQ or C++ source code fully functional :-)
- BB - HL cpp indicator available

2014-06-25:
- ZigZag cpp indicator available
- C++ functions added:
// ''RQEXPORT function setimportedfile (importedfilestr,importedfileoffsetstr)
// ''RQEXPORT function shiftgridsonebackward()
// ''RQEXPORT function reversebarscomputesubbcpp(graphbarnboncurstaticstr)
// ''RQEXPORT function refreshgridscpp()
closing charts out of all opened charts is now taken into account for C++ indicators
reversing bars is now taken into account for C++ indicators
- assertion error messages disabled

2014-06-26:
- Center Of Gravity cpp indicator available :-)
- optimization of the memory allocation for arrays

2014-06-27:
- files importation optimized
- added C++ functions :
// ''RQEXPORT function getdatagrid (rowgridoffsetstr,offsetstr)
// ''RQEXPORT function setdatagrid (rowgridoffsetstr,offsetstr,datavalstr)
// ''RQEXPORT function getchartbars (chartnbstr)
// ''RQEXPORT function getchartbarstmp (chartnbtmpstr)
// ''RQEXPORT function tfmultok_clickcpp(tfmultstr)
// ''RQEXPORT function savegridtmpcpp()
// ''RQEXPORT function setchartbars (chartbarsdisplayedfilestr,chartbarsoffsetstr)
// ''RQEXPORT function setchartbarstmp (chartbarstmpdisplayedfilestr,chartbarstmpoffsetstr)
- tf multiplier changes now affects C++ indicators
- exp10sub now affects C++ indicators
- automation sub uses C++ functions

2014-06-30:

be used for indicators like ADR112 cpp
- added datetimeserial calculation for the useindifunc C++ function
- added ibarshift C++ function
all these things are still buggy

2014-07-10:
- added C++ functions writetfcpp, setcharttf
maybe buggy
- added indicator ADR112 cpp, still buggy

double itype(int,int,int);
double ima(int,int,int,int,int,int);
int ihighest(int,int,int,int);
int ilowest(int,int,int,int);
- added WaterLevel cpp indicator and it works :-)
you need first to attribute a timeframe of 60 and 1440 and then you can add the WaterLevel indicator to your chart

2014-07-17:
- WaterLevel indicator and ADR Lines indicator added to the autoreverse expert

2014-07-18:
- now autoreverse expert exports collection automatically in QChartist directory when a signal is found

2014-11-20:
- you can check for updates with an internet connection
- you can draw fibofans with symetry from point (settings button)
- you can draw polygones : pentagone, hexagone, octogone (settings button)

2014-11-23:
- You can see what's new when checking for updates

2014-11-26:

(you can control them with keys left and right when they got the focus)

2014-11-27:
- QChartist can download and install updates automatically

2014-11-28:
- Correction of a bug with the fibo fans symetry from point
- Now update can update update.exe

2014-11-29:
- You can use hotkeys when the "Snif key" textbox got the focus (just left click in it), then:
press key "s" to play a sound depending on the angle of the trendline tool (it's a funny way to draw approx. parallels)
press space bar to simulate a click on the chart (useful if you want to draw something but your mouse cursor is outside the chart)

2014-12-01:
- "s" hotkey is working for all drawing tools

2014-12-02:
- You can chat with other QChartist users!

2014-12-08 (build 3):
- After you made an upgrade with update.exe ; to avoid bugs, it is strongly advised that you recompile it 
with QTStart.bat (Close the app first). Sometimes it may QTStart.bat may freeze ; if it is the case,
close the console and rqpc, and then restart QTStart.bat
- build 4: counted bars changed to 400 for the autoreverse expert
- build 4: COG of RSTL conditions added to the autoreverse expert
- build 5: New indicator Levels (You need to attribute a timeframe of 1440 first)

uses latitude, longitude and altitude set in astro wheel settings (just the moon shows small
differences when the topo position is changed. Of course asc and mc show big differences.
Differences with other planets are too small to be visible on the wheel.)
- added cities with latitude,longitute,altitude,timezone presets in data wheel settings
