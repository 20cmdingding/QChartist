versions Changes        (read from bottom to top :)
----------------
v 2772    - when a file was ''include, scanning started at
            line index inherited from the line containing 
            ''include in the mother file. Could Bug, it skipped
            few lines in the 'included file.
          - With FB, when a   ''RQEXPORT data:string dataname 
            was used, the pointer to all ''RQEXPORT functions
            after that was wrong, called with StrPtr(functionName)
            and not @FunctionName as it should. (sDataType was
            not reset)
v 0.2740    Solved bug in case RC.EXE path, Libs path or Include
            path is an empty string.
v 0.2705    Added FB_VERSION and FB_LANG in RQPC.INI
            to allow use of FreeBasic version 017 and later
            In ''pre cmd these 2 parameters can be modified with
            FBVERSION=<016|017|...> and FBLANG=<""|QB|deprecated|...>
v 0.2700    (better works with RapidQ32.Dll   V109)
          - add flag ''pre cmd printf . In gcc, the stdin/out/err
            did not work. With "printf" it will. It helps to
            debug gcc code. (same problem, not yet solved, with bcc)
            No need of "printf" to have the rapidq "Print" work.
            with "printf" exe size is much larger 250k vs 10k
          - if NoDone is set, TinyDone is disabled if present
            (= set false)
          - files passed in ''pre cmd options can now contain space
            providing they are passed between double quotes
            (as in Command line)
          - now BCC icon accepts path with space (it was a rqpc bug)
          - windres, the MinGw resource compiler does not work
            with path including space ... maybe a new version ???.
            Google: [ mingw-Bugs-1640385 ] windres.and spaces in path
          - add possibility to modify maximum Run Time Link
            buffer size. With RTLBUFF=666666
            This can be done in RQPC.INI with RTL_BUFFER=
            in command line with RTLBUFF=123456 and in a
            ''pre cmd line with RTLBUFF=9999
            Default is 32708. Will accept something like 1000
            resolved names. Warning on Overflow in launcher codes.
            With FreeBasic: no limit, no warning.
          - solved masm pb called from another drive
            Environ ("PATH=" & sPath & ";" & Left$(MASM32_ROOT_DIR, _
                                     Len(MASM32_ROOT_DIR) - 1) &";")
            Environ ("INCLUDE=" & MASM32_ROOT_DIR & "include")
            Environ ("LIB=" & MASM32_ROOT_DIR & "lib")
          - if upx is set, no TinyDone ... may bug with resource
            hacker if TinyDone is set on an already upxed file
          - RQ32DLL=ANYTHING.DLL is the DLL called to execute
            the bytecode if no ADDDLL is used. When a ADDDLL is
            set as option, RQ32.DLL in RQPC directory is always
            used and extracted at Runtime as RQ32.DLL
          - Exe Command Line bugs solved: double space accepted,
            Tab accepted, ...  for all Compiler
          - Exe Can now be run without its .exe extension
            for all supported compilers
          - to be used, ResHacker.Exe and Upx.Exe must be present
            in the same directory as RQPC
          - added new command line or ''pre cmd options:
            "ADDDLL"   = "ADDRQ32DLL"   for flagAddDll = True
            "NODLL"    = "NOADDRQ32DLL" for flagAddDll = False (default)
            "UPX"   for flagUpx = True
            "NOUPX" for flagUpx = False     (default)
            added in  "RQPC.INI FLAG_ADDDLL=0"  "FLAG_UPX=0"
          - if FLAG_UPX=1 then the code is upxed (full exe ~450K)
             default=0
          - ResHacker addoverwrite resource:
             - bytecode     name: NBYTECODE, type: TBYTECODE
             - icon         name: MAINICON,  type: ICONGROUP
             if FLAG_ADDDLL=1   default=0
               - RQ32.Dll   name: NRQ32DLL,  type: TRQ32DLL
                 dll will be load as resource in the exe and
                 extracted to app directory at start.
                 RapidQ32.Dll must be copied to RQPC directory
                 and renamed "RQ32.DLL". RQ32.DLL can be UPXED (340K)
            Resource language is always 0
          - uses ResHacker to build tiny exe, bytecode is a
            true resource, not appended anymore (Paul's idea)
            (Exe is now a full plain PE. Can now be upxed ie)

v 0.2133  (better work RapidQ32.Dll 109)
          - Known bug:
            - error at MASM compile when source code is not on the
              same drive as MASM (will be solved later)
          - Limitations for RQPC and all .Exe build with RQPC:
            - must be run RQPC.EXE the .exe is mandatory
            - multiple space in command line is considered
              as end of command line
            - TAB in commandline are not recognized
          - add .RC merge, all the .RC passed will be merged and
            appended to the RQPC MAINICON and ??? setting
          - to force launcher recompile without writing an external
            code add null.asm, null.cpp, null.fbb or null.bpp in a
            ''pre cmd line or in the command line. only work when
            one single external code file is added
          - Set Resource Icon to MAINICON in all external compiler
            launcher. With version, 109 of RapidQ32.Dll, Form and
            application icon will automatically be inherited
            Thank you Paul
          - suppressed CreateWindowEx in External Compiler Launcher
            Thank you Paul.
          - add "AddDone" = "Done" which reset the flagNoDone. When
            flag_NO_DONE was set in the INI, it was then impossible
            to reset it in the code.
          - accept more than one module .Asm, .Fbb, .Cpp, Bcc, with
            Masm main. Some limitations, see examples
v 0.1920   Gcc error outpout captured correctly.
v 0.1912   20 minutes later, RQPC no more open a console
v 0.1911   first upload
