QChartist is an open source trading software.
As to my personal progress, the software has evolved along, slowly but surely. I got a little inspired from MT4 allowing a fairly easy portability of programmed indicators from MT4 to QChartist.
It is now faster and much more professional thanks to the use of a C++ layer (used mostly for calculations) over the standard Basic layer (used mostly for the GUI interface).
The last news are the possibility to use functions from a library for astronomic calculations (some new indicators and an astro wheel inspired from the work of W.D. Gann make reference).
You can get realtime quotations thanks to perl scripts.
The RapidQ compiler being 32 bit only and by the fact that it isn't kept up to date by its author, one day maybe it won't work any longer under Windows (when 32 bit support will be discontinued). My will being to be able to use QChartist and to develop it as long as possible, i did all what was needed throughout its development in order to make it 100% compatible with Wine 1.4 under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
The purpose of Wine being exactly to sustain the use of old 16 and 32 bit softwares and make them cross platform at the same time.
If you are interested to try QChartist or even to improve it, you can download it directly from my website here:

IMPORTANT: i just ask that you respect the following things when you use my software:
- to keep my name and my email intact everywhere i did mention it in the software files.
- if you use portions of my source files in your project, i ask that you mention my name and my email in your project (somewhere visible to the final user)
- to share your source files with me when you improve the software
Thank you for using my software and i wish that you will appreciate the fruit of so many years of work.
